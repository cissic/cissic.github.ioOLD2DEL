** How to set English as the default language of git commit comments

The following is based on [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/10872202][this post]].

Add these lines to your =~/.bashrc=, =~/.bash_profile= or =~/.zprofile= to force git to display all messages in English:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE bash
    # Set Git language to English
    #alias git='LANG=en_US git'
    alias git='LANG=en_GB git'
#+END_EXAMPLE bash

The alias needs to override =LC_ALL= on some systems, when the environment variable =LC_ALL= is set, which has precedence over =LANG=. See the [UNIX Specification - Environment Variables](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xbd/envvar.html) for further explanation.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    # Set Git language to English
    #alias git='LC_ALL=en_US git'
    alias git='LC_ALL=en_GB git'
#+END_EXAMPLE

In case you added these lines to =~/.bashrc= the alias will be defined when a new interactive shell gets started. In case you added it to =~/.bash_profile= the alias will be applied when logging in
